# Java-Graphics-Genetics
Idea is taken from CodingTrain.
Black Circles represent the rockets and red circle acts as a target
Purpose is for rockets to reach target using genetic algorithm
For future to add:
        1. barrier for rockets
        2. graph/diagram showing the progress of population
P.S.
